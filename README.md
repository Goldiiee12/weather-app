# Weather-App Overview

Welcome to the overview of my Weather App project! This document highlights the key features and technologies used in the development of a simple yet functional weather application. Our app allows users to input their location to fetch and display the current weather information.

## Project Structure

- **HTML Document**: The project begins with a basic `index.html` file that includes the foundational HTML5 structure. This file serves as the entry point for the application.
- **CSS Styling**: The application's visual appearance is defined in `style.css`. This stylesheet contains custom styles for the form, weather information display, and any additional elements, ensuring a pleasant user interface.
- **JavaScript Logic**: The core functionality of the app is encapsulated in `main.js`. This includes functions for interacting with the weather API, processing the returned JSON data, and dynamically updating the webpage with the fetched weather details.

## Key Features

- **Location-Based Weather Information**: Users can enter their location into a form, which the app uses to fetch weather data specific to the entered area.
- **Dynamic Data Display**: The weather information, once retrieved, is displayed directly on the webpage. This includes details such as temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions.
- **Loading Component**: An optional feature implemented is the loading indicator, which appears while the weather data is being fetched and disappears once the data retrieval is complete. This feature enhances the user experience, especially on low-end devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (including API requests)

## Final Product

The project has been successfully completed and is now live for users to interact with. The user interface is intuitive, allowing easy navigation and use. Styling has been applied to ensure the app is visually appealing, and the optional loading component has been tested across different devices for optimal performance.
